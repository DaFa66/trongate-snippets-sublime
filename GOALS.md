-   [ ] Continue with the Snippets for the Trongate framework

## Goal Details

-   I have a goal of 50 snippets before I submit to package.io. Some of these snippets may evolve to better workflows and productivity.

-   Syntax color highlighting is a feature I love about code editors and IDEs. This is what is coming up in Sublime Text for Trongate!

-   An interactive help system for the Trongate Framework and snippets are possible right through Sublime! The possibilities of an installer for this is also being considered.

-   Visual Studio has invented Intellisense and deserves to be implemented in Sublime Text.

-   Snippets will be continued to be sought out and put into the repository for Speed Coding.

-   Installer will be created to be purchased, possibly through using Paypal to start!
