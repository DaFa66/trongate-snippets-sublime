# Goals for Smitty's Trongate Snipppets

-   [ ] Push 50 snippets to trongate.
-   [ ] Syntax Color Highlighting
-   [ ] Trongate Intellisense

## Goal Details

- I have a goal of 50 snippets before I submit to package.io. Some of these snippets may evolve to better workflows and productivity.

- Syntax color highlighting is a feature I love about code editors and IDEs. This is what is coming up in Sublime Text for Trongate!

- Visual Studio has invented Intellisense and deserves to be implemented in Sublime Text.
