## About these snippets

### All developers

Do you feel tired of frameworks that break with new features and filling you with too much space in your sink? Are your fingers getting sore from the constant coding and pounding of your keyboard? Well, welcome to The __Trongate Framework__, developed at [_Speed Coding Academy_](https://www.speedcodingacademy.com).

These snippets make it __faster__ and __easier__ to use the __Trongate Framework__. This is important for developers who want their __work done__ in __faster time__.

Both The [__Trongate website__](https://trongate.io) and The [__Trongate Framework__](https://github.com/davidjconnelly/trongate-framework) can be downloaded on Github.

These snippets are to make life easier and faster then before using the __Trongate Framework__. For sure, this will create a __better experience__ and __workflow__ toards your future __using__ the amazing __Trongate eco-system__.

### Speed Coding Academy

As a __founding member__ at __Speed Coding Academy__,
with _Trongate_, companion tools, and these snippets, there is __no doubt you can create anything__ at lightning fast speeds!

Of course, recommendations from Speed Coding Academy are always appreciated inside the forum for improvements.

Folks at the academy, these are your passports to having __keys__ to __operating at jet speeds__!

When you use these snippets inside _Sublime Text_ within HTML files, or HTML within PHP, simply use the less than sign(<). As soon you start typing, it will display all the snippets. If it is directly within PHP itself, it should automatically show all of the _Trongate Snippets_ as soon as you type. There is now a _VSCode_ extension, thanks to _Simon_ and _Jake_!
